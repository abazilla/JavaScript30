### 1.JavaScript Drum Kit
A really fun thing to play around with. I'd like to attempt to change the sounds to make it even better :) I never thought about it, but it makes sense that you have to consider every little detail to change when you're making animations like this (ie the very subtle animation on keypress).

### 2. JS & CSS clock

I think I understand what `` lets you do - it allows you to embad JS into html/css elements, sort of like how #{} works in ruby.

  *** Extra: *** Refactored the conversion of time to degrees into 2 new functions (1 for hours and minutes, and 1 for hours).
