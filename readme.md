# JavaScript30 by me!

Starting 27/04/17, I will be doing JavaScript30 - the 30 Day Vanilla JS Coding Challenge.

Starter Files + Completed solutions for the JavaScript 30 Day Challenge.

### 1.JavaScript Drum Kit
A really fun thing to play around with. I'd like to attempt to change the sounds to make it even better :) I never thought about it, but it makes sense that you have to consider every little detail to change when you're making animations like this (ie the very subtle animation on keypress).

### 2. JS & CSS clock

I think I understand what " ``` `` ``` " lets you do - it allows you to embad JS into html/css elements, sort of like how #{} works in ruby.

  *** Extra: *** Refactored the conversion of time to degrees into 2 new functions (1 for hours and minutes, and 1 for hours).

### 3. CSS Variables

Cool to know that CSS has the ability to use variables (and can be manipulatied by JS). Datasets are looking more and more useful to use too.

  *** Extra: *** Added another variable to change the rotation of the image, to help further my understanding of how this works.

### 4. Array Cardio Day

This one was quite difficult - a lot of new things learnt, from arrow functions to lots of different array methods. I've added to do lists so that I can refer to my teacher for further explanation when I am at school. * Hint: use a todo searcher to search through your open project to find the things you need to re-learn *
